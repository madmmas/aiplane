# AIPlane — Development Log

A running journal of **engineering decisions, trade-offs, and dead ends**.

This is intentionally separate from [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md):

| | CHANGELOG | DEVLOG |
|---|---|---|
| Audience | Users / adopters | Contributors / future-you |
| Answers | *What* shipped (by version) | *Why* we chose it, and what we rejected |
| Tone | Concise, release-oriented | First-person narrative |

## Format

**One file:** this document (`docs/DEVLOG.md`), with reverse-chronological dated
entries (`## YYYY-MM-DD — title`). Newest entry at the top.

We chose a single file over `docs/devlog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` because the project
is still early and a showcase benefits from one searchable narrative. If this
file grows past ~a few dozen entries or parallel authors start colliding, split
into dated files then — do not fork the format prematurely.

### When to add an entry

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Short version: non-trivial architecture
decisions, explicit trade-offs, and dead ends that someone would otherwise have to
reverse-engineer from git history.

## 2026-07-24 — Cost rates compute-on-ingest + summary APIs (#58)

Chose **compute-on-ingest** over a scheduled aggregation job: simpler MVP, cost is
queryable immediately, and clients can still override by sending `costUsd`
explicitly. When `costUsd` is null/absent, `UsageService` calls `CostRateRegistry`
(`(inputTokens/1000)*inputUsdPer1k + (outputTokens/1000)*outputUsdPer1k`, scale 8
to match `NUMERIC(16,8)`).

Rates live under `aiplane.cost-rates.rates` in `application.yml` (not Java switch
statements) — a few Anthropic/OpenAI defaults matching mock models. Unknown models
→ cost `0`; first sighting WARN, subsequent DEBUG.

Read APIs: `GET /usage/summary?period=` (`7d` / `30d` / `yyyy-MM`),
`GET /usage/events?from=&to=` (limit 500), and `GET /usage/costs/projection` —
formula is `(sum cost over last 7d) / 7 * 30`. Dashboard UI stays in #59; this PR
only adds api-client hooks/mocks.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Usage event ingest envelope + auth stub (#57)

`POST /api/v1/usage/events` accepts a forward-compatible envelope
`{ "events": [ ... ] }` (not a bare JSON array) so we can add batch-level
metadata later without a breaking change. Response is
`{ "accepted": N, "events": [ ... ] }` with server-generated `ue_*` ids when
clients omit `id`. Validation is all-or-nothing: any bad row rejects the whole
batch with `400` and an `errors: ["[i] …"]` list; nothing is persisted.

Auth is intentionally open for now — same as prompts/guardrails — until Phase 4
wires API-key auth (`ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter`). V8 `usage_events` already
matched the TypeScript `UsageEvent` shape; persistence follows the Prompt JPA
pattern (`@Entity` + Spring Data) rather than Guardrail's JdbcTemplate.

## 2026-07-24 — Prompt Manager MFE mirrors Guardrail patterns (#53)

`apps/prompt-manager` now follows the same federation + React Query + mockable
`@repo/api-client` shape as Guardrail (#56): shared QueryClient / ApiClientProvider,
mutable in-memory prompt/version fixtures with `resetPromptMocks()`, and a single-page
composition (library → timeline → editor → playground) instead of react-router for MVP.

Playground UI calls `POST .../playground/run` through `useRunPlayground`; promote uses
`POST .../versions/{vid}/promote` so the UI only needs one action for draft→testing→active.

## 2026-07-24 — Playground via mockable Spring AI port (#52)

`POST /api/v1/prompts/{id}/playground/run` loads a version (explicit `versionId` or
active), resolves `{{variable}}` placeholders, then calls `PromptPlaygroundRunner`.
The production `@Primary` bean (`SpringAiPromptPlaygroundRunner`) uses Spring AI
`ChatClient` against Anthropic/OpenAI `ChatModel`s from `LlmProviderFactory`.

**Optional keys:** we depend on `spring-ai-openai` / `spring-ai-anthropic` (model
libs, not Boot starters) and build models only when `OPENAI_API_KEY` /
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are set — missing keys leave the app booting and return 503
"provider not configured" at call time. HTTP read/connect timeout is 30s
(`aiplane.playground.timeout`); timeouts → 504, other provider failures → 502.
Unit tests mock the runner/factory — no live API calls in CI.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Version promotion state machine + export hook stub (#51)

Promotion is a strict path (`draft → testing → active → archived`) on
`PromptVersionStatus.canTransitionTo` — no skipping Testing. Activating a version
archives any other active row for that prompt, sets `prompts.active_version_id`,
and calls `PromptConfigExporter.onVersionActivated`. The default bean
(`NoOpPromptConfigExporter`) only logs; Phase 5 owns the Config Server write.

Primary API is SPEC's `PATCH .../versions/{vid}/status`; `POST .../promote`
advances one step for convenience. Both share the same transition service path.

## 2026-07-24 — Adopted JPA for prompts (JdbcTemplate stays for project/guardrail)

#50 finally resolves the SPEC vs scaffold drift called out on 2026-07-22:
`api-server` now depends on `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` with
`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate` so Flyway remains the schema owner.

Prompts and prompt versions are real `@Entity` / Spring Data repositories over
V2/V3 tables (`TEXT[]` tags via `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.ARRAY)`, JSONB
parameters/metrics via `SqlTypes.JSON`). Version create always lands as `draft`
with an auto-incremented version number — promotion (#51) and playground (#52)
stay out of this PR.

**Deliberate hybrid:** project and guardrail keep JdbcTemplate. Rewriting working
JDBC repositories just to "unify" would bloat the Prompt CRUD PR and risk
regressions in Phase 2 surfaces. New domains that match SPEC's entity model
should prefer JPA; migrate older JDBC packages when they next need a substantial
change.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Guardrail UI: mock-first hooks + host Tailwind

#56 builds the guardrail remote on `@repo/api-client` hooks against the #55 REST
shape, with mock evaluation so the MFE works before flipping `useMocks: false`.
Shared `@tanstack/react-query` and `@repo/api-client` as Module Federation
singletons so the remote can reuse the dashboard's providers/context. Ordering
uses Up/Down buttons (not DnD) — enough for MVP and easier to test with RTL.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Guardrail sets: ordered JDBC membership + short-circuit flag

#55 adds CRUD for `guardrail_sets` / `guardrail_set_members` and
`POST /api/v1/guardrail-sets/:id/evaluate`. Evaluation order is the `position` column
(ascending). Short-circuit is a first-class column (`V10__guardrail_sets_short_circuit`)
defaulting to `true`, overridable per evaluate request — so a test panel can "run all
rules" without mutating the saved set.

Still on JdbcTemplate (same deliberate SPEC drift as the scaffold). Individual guardrail
CRUD shipped in the same PR because sets are useless without members; UI (#56) will call
both.

Also flipped Maven `parameters>true</parameters>` so Spring MVC can bind `@PathVariable` /
`@RequestParam` without repeating names everywhere. Hardened
`AbstractPostgresIntegrationTest` to start Postgres once in a static initializer — `@Container`
on a shared parent was stopping the DB between IT classes once we added more of them.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Guardrail evaluators as Spring AI CallAdvisor (before CRUD)

Phase 2 starts with pure evaluators (#54) before persistence/CRUD (#55) and UI (#56). I
wanted the rule engine usable from a playground-style `ChatClient` call without waiting on
guardrail set tables or REST.

**Choice:** implement `GuardrailEvaluator` strategies + `GuardrailCallAdvisor` implementing
Spring AI 1.0 `CallAdvisor`, and add only `spring-ai-client-chat` to `api-server` (advisor
API, no provider starter). Rules are an in-memory `GuardrailRule` list for now; #55 will
load ordered sets from Flyway V5 and construct the advisor per evaluate request.

**ReDoS:** user regex is an injection/DoS surface (security rule). `RegexPatternGuard` caps
pattern length (256), rejects nested/overlapping quantifier shapes, and
`RegexFilterEvaluator` matches with a 100ms wall-clock timeout on a daemon thread. Not a
formal safety proof — enough to refuse the obvious catastrophic patterns and bound match
time.

**Rejected:** shipping only a keyword list via Spring AI's built-in `SafeGuardAdvisor`. It
covers one of three MVP types and has no max-length / regex / stage / action model. Better
to own the advisor and keep SafeGuard as inspiration for failure-response shape.

## 2026-07-22 — JdbcTemplate first, JPA later (and living with the SPEC drift)

I scaffolded `api-server` with `spring-boot-starter-jdbc` and wrote the first
integration test against raw `JdbcTemplate` + Flyway + Testcontainers. That was
the fastest path to prove "Spring Boot boots, migrations apply, health is up."

`docs/SPEC.md` §1 still lists **Spring Data JPA** as the persistence story. I did
not resolve that contradiction in the scaffold PR on purpose: renaming the data
access approach mid-scaffold would have bloated an already large "get the modular
monolith compiling" change. The Cursor rule in
`.cursor/rules/spring-boot-backend.mdc` now calls the drift out so Phase 1 Prompt
CRUD cannot pretend it does not exist.

What I almost did and rejected: adding JPA entities with no repositories and no
endpoints "for later." Empty JPA on the classpath looks like progress and is
actually debt — Hibernate would idle next to an unused entity model while Flyway
owned the real schema. Prefer one honest stack until Prompt CRUD forces the
choice: either adopt JPA for real in that PR, or update the SPEC to say
JdbcTemplate / Spring JDBC is the deliberate approach.

## 2026-07-16 — Rebranded the product, left the Java package as `aimanager`

The UI, docs, and Maven `groupId` became **AIPlane** / `dev.madmmas.aiplane`. The
Java package root is still `dev.madmmas.aimanager`. That is not an oversight I
forgot to finish in the same PR — it is a deliberate deferral.

A full package rename touches every `.java` file, logging config in
`application.yml`, both Dockerfiles, and any import path a future contributor
copy-pastes from the SPEC. Doing it inside the rebrand PR would have mixed a
marketing/docs change with a mechanical blast radius that is hard to review and
easy to get subtly wrong (one missed import, one stale log category). The SPEC
still documents `dev.madmmas.aimanager` as the package root for that reason.

The cost is cognitive: newcomers will wonder if "aimanager" means the product
was renamed incompletely. The answer lives here — use AIPlane everywhere
user-facing; treat the Java package rename as its own issue when we are ready to
land it as a focused chore, not as drive-by cleanup inside a feature PR.

## 2026-07-22 — OSS standard setup as a mergeable baseline, not a wish list

Issue [#7](https://github.com/madmmas/aiplane/issues/7) asked for the usual open-source
floor: license, community docs, lint/format, CI, Dependabot, and branch protection.
I treated that as "make `main` safe to collaborate on," not "document what we hope
to do later."

What mattered in practice:

- **Biome over ESLint/Prettier** so the frontend monorepo has one formatter/linter
  story. Adding a second tool in the same role is how config drifts start.
- **Husky blocking direct commits to `main`** locally, matching GitHub branch
  protection that requires the `ci` job. Protection that only exists on GitHub
  still lets you push a broken main from a laptop that skipped the UI.
- Closing the loop in [PR #35](https://github.com/madmmas/aiplane/pull/35) after the
  earlier OSS PR, so the issue tracker and the repo state agreed.

What I did not bolt on in that pass (and should not pretend was done): CODEOWNERS,
CHANGELOG, DEVLOG, and real test execution in CI. Those became follow-up hygiene
issues so the foundation PR stayed reviewable. A showcase repo that claims
"contributions welcome" without a green required check and a documented workflow
is performative — the baseline had to be real first.
