# Contributing to AIPlane

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AIPlane! This document outlines how to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18 (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) for the recommended version)
- **pnpm** 9.x

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Install dependencies from the repo root:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start all apps in development mode:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The dashboard (host) runs at http://localhost:5173. All remotes must be running for Module Federation to work.

## Development workflow

Before submitting a pull request, run:

```bash
pnpm lint        # Check formatting and lint rules
pnpm typecheck   # TypeScript type checking
pnpm test        # Vitest unit/component tests
pnpm build       # Production build
```

You can also use `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test`, and `make build` as shortcuts.

### Frontend tests

Colocate tests next to the file under test (`Button.tsx` → `Button.test.tsx`). Use React Testing Library queries (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`) and MSW for HTTP mocks in `packages/api-client`. See the **Frontend testing** section in [`README.md`](README.md).

To auto-fix lint and format issues:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

## Architecture

For product intent, architecture decisions, and the full roadmap, see [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md).

## Pull requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main` (direct commits to `main` are blocked locally by Husky and on GitHub by branch protection).
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits. Link the issue (`Closes #N` in the PR body).
3. Fill out the pull request template completely.
4. Ensure the required `ci` check passes (lint → typecheck → test → build). Merges to `main` require a green `ci` status. The `backend` job also runs `mvn verify` (unit + Testcontainers + JaCoCo); keep it green even when it is not a required check.
5. For **user-facing** changes (features, fixes, breaking behavior), add an entry under
   `[Unreleased]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) in the same PR — Keep a Changelog
   categories (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` / `Deprecated` / `Security`).
   Pure chores, internal refactors, and docs-only PRs do not need a CHANGELOG line unless
   they affect how users or downstream apps consume the project.

Code owners listed in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) are auto-requested for review
on matching paths.
